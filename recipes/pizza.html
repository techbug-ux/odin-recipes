    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>⅔ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle yeast over surface of warm water in a large bowl. Let stand for 1 minute, then stir to dissolve. </li>
        <li>Mix in flour, salt, and olive oil. When dough is too thick to stir, turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes. Knead in a little more flour if dough is too sticky.</li>
        <li>Place into an oiled bowl, cover, and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). If using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven as well, setting it on the lowest shelf.</li>
        <li>When dough has risen, flatten it out on a lightly floured surface. Roll or stretch out into a 12-inch circle, and place on a baking pan. If you are using a pizza stone, you may place it on a piece of parchment while preheating the stone in the oven.</li>
        <li>Spread tomato sauce evenly over dough. Sprinkle with oregano, mozzarella cheese, basil, Romano cheese, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until bottom of crust is browned when you lift up the edge a little, and cheese is melted and bubbly. Cool for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
